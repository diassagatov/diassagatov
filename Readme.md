 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I grew up in a small village in West Kazakhstan where computers were like mythical creatures until I hit around 10 years old. Back then, I had no clue about programming; I was just obsessed with building things.

Fast forward to my time at Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Uralsk. That's where things started to get interesting. I got a taste for logic and problem-solving.

Then came Nazarbayev University, where I dove headfirst into Computer Science. It was like diving into a whole new universe. Over the years, I wrangled with C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and even Assembly (yeah, don't ask why). And then there was Verilog and Prolog – they sounded like spells from a wizard's book.

But here’s the kicker – I realized I needed more than just languages. I needed frameworks to bring my ideas to life. That’s how I stumbled upon React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. For about a year and a half, I dove headfirst into these tools, tinkering away on pet projects that turned into my playground.

Now? Well, I’m sitting pretty as the lead frontend developer at a Kazakhstani startup called iCan. Did it take ages to get here? Hell yeah. Would I do it all over again? Absolutely.

Because it’s not about the time spent; it’s about that sweet satisfaction that comes from overcoming challenges, not just grabbing the easy wins.
